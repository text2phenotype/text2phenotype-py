08/30/02 11:00 AM 	EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT/ Dr. Scarlet, Bates No. 1 	Patient admitted to the ER at City Hospital with expressive aphasia & right facial droop. In no acute distress. Chief complaint: slurred speech & difficulty finding words. Temp 37 P 60 R 16 BP 178/80 Allergies: none known Past history: HTN (hypertension), treated with Lopressor Coronary artery disease (CAD), treated with Lipitor for high cholesterol & Ecotrin daily. Abdominal hysterectomy Physical exam: all within normal limits except the right facial droop with aphasia. IV is started EKG is done (unremarkable) Blood sugar is checked (ok) Neurology is called. 	It is important to do the CT scan of the brain immediately on patients with suspected stroke. It is important to know the cause of the stroke to administer the proper treatment. There are 2 types of stroke: 1. Ischemic which means a blockage. This is seen in people with coronary artery disease (CAD). This means that there are fatty deposits in the arteries and blood products form on the fat deposits, break off and lodge in the vessels of the brain causing obstruction. This is treated with fibrinolytic therapy (thin the blood to prevent more clots). Medications are given to accomplish this. 2. The other major cause of strokes is hemorrhage to the brain that can be caused by an aneurysm, a weakening of a vessel. This can break and cause bleeding and hemorrhage. Surgery would be required to correct this. 
		CT scan of the brain is done. Labs are drawn including hematology & chemistry Transfer under the care of Dr. Mustard. 	Reference: Ref 1 American Heart Association / Acute Coronary Syndromes & Stroke 1994

On treatment for HTN & CAD. Also Ecotrin daily. Physical exam: unremarkable the right facial droop with aphasia. CT scan revealed no acute abnormality. Observe patient & start Ecotrin & Plavix. Plan in doctor's orders. 	Ecotrin & Plavix are blood thinners to prevent the formation of blood clots. The patient has been taking Ecotrin @ home. Labs were drawn showing normal platelets with a high MVP & normal Hgb & Hct. No coagulation (PT, PTT, INR) studies are ordered. Starting anticoagulant therapy without a baseline coagulation study. This high level indicates a need for more platelets, Ecotrin & Plavix have been started without basic coagulation studies, PT, PTT & INR. Reference: test

The Glasgow Coma Score is used to quantify the neurological changes following stroke and allows a uniform description of the patients condition. The best possible score is 15, the worst possible score is 3. A Glasgow Coma Score of 8 or less is consistent with the definition of coma. This is a good assessment tool to monitor the patients condition. Reference: Ref 2 The Internet Stroke Center / American Stroke Association / Glasgow coma score / 1974

08/30/02 06:31 PM 	PROGRESS NOTES / Dr. Peacock / Primary care physician 	68 yr. old white female, previous hx of HTN for 30 yrs., CAD & abdominal hysterectomy. Is being treated with Lopressor & Lipitor for high cholesterol. Presented with expressive aphasia & mild facial droop. Family history of strokes, HTN & heart attacks. The patient is awake, oriented & in no distress. Impression: TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack) Neurological checks, continue Ecotrin & Plavix & check the labs. 	A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient stroke that lasts only a few minutes. It occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is briefly interrupted. TIA symptoms, which usually occur suddenly, are similar to those of stroke but do not last as long. Most symptoms of a TIA disappear within an hour, although they may persist for up to 24 hours. Symptoms can include: numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body. Because there is no way to tell whether symptoms are from a TIA or an acute stroke, patients should assume that all stroke-like symptoms signal an emergency and should not wait to see if they go away. A prompt evaluation (within 60 minutes) is necessary to identify the cause of the TIA and determine appropriate therapy. Depending on a patient's medical history and the results of a medical examination, the doctor may recommend drug therapy or surgery to reduce the risk of stroke in people who have had a TIA. The use of antiplatelet agents, particularly aspirin, is a standard treatment for patients at risk for stroke. TIA's are often warning signs that a person is at risk for a more serious and debilitating stroke.

The carotid arteries are on each side of the neck. The carotid arteries deliver oxygen- rich blood from the heart to the head and brain.

This order suggested range for therapeutic therapy is 50-75 any value over or under will be called to the nursing units as a critical value. The high values states clotting is taking to long, increasing the chance of a bleeding. The low value states the clotting is happening to quickly which would increase the chance of increasing blood clots. PTT is a very important value to monitor during heparin therapy. PTT should be drawn: Before dosage begins 6 hours post initiation of therapy 6 hours post dosage adjustment 2x day when on maintenance dosage Reference: Ref 3 Standard guidelines when administering Heparin

Platelet inhibitors prevent clotting and increasing the inability to clot takes away the main defense in heparinized patients have to prevent hemorrhage.
