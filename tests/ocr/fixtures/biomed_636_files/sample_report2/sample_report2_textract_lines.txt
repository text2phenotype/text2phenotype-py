insufficient evidence to associate the drug with either benefit or lack of benefit.

ERCC1
Drug/biomarker association(s) supported by the highest level of clinical evidence.
Therapies associated with potential benefit or lack of benefit are based on biomarker results and published medical evidence derived from multiple tumor types. The selection of any,
all, or none of the matched therapies resides solely with the discretion of the treating physician. Decisions on patient care and treatment must be based on the independent medical
judgment of the treating physician, taking into consideration all available information concerning the patient's condition in accordance with the applicable standard of care.

SPECIMEN INFORMATION
Specimen ID: ABC-1234-XX
Specimen Collected: XX-Mon-2017
Specimen Received: XX-Mon-2017
Testing Initiated: XX-Mon-2017
Gross description: 1 (A) Paraffin Block - Client ID (ABC-123-XY) from XYZ Medical Center, Springfield, XY, with the corresponding cytology
report labeled "ABC-123-XY".
Pathologic Diagnosis: Left inguinal lymph node needle biopsy: Metastatic carcinoma.
Dissection Information: Molecular testing of this specimen was performed after harvesting of targeted tissues with an approved manual
microdissection technique. Candidate slides were examined under a microscope and areas containing tumor cells (and separately normal cells, when
necessary
for
testing)
were
circled.
A
laboratory
technician
harvested
targeted
tissues
for
extractionfrom
the
marked
areas
using
a
dissection
microscope.
The areas marked and extracted were microscopically reexamined on post-microdissected slides and adequacy of microdissection was verified by a
board certified Pathologist.
