          <p id="s1p42">Patient Notes:</p>
          <p id="s1p43">2017-07-19: ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: 1. Respiratory arrest. 2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 3. Coronary</p>
          <p id="s1p44">artery disease. 4. History of hypertension. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Status post-respiratory arrest. 2. Chronic</p>
          <p id="s1p45">obstructive pulmonary disease. 3. Congestive heart failure. 4. History of coronary artery disease. 5. History of</p>
          <p id="s1p46">hypertension. History of the Present Illness: The patient is a 49-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital in</p>
          <p id="s1p47">respiratory distress, and had to be intubated shortly after admission to the emergency room. The patient's past history is</p>
          <p id="s1p48">notable for a history of coronary artery disease with prior myocardial infarctions in 1995 and 1999. The patient has</p>
          <p id="s1p49">recently been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has been smoking up until</p>
          <p id="s1p50">three to four months previously. On the day of admission, the patient had the sudden onset of severe dyspnea and called</p>
          <p id="s1p51">an ambulance. The patient denied any gradual increase in wheezing, any increase in cough, any increase in chest pain,</p>
          <p id="s1p52">any increase in sputum prior to the onset of his sudden dyspnea. ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:</p>
          <p id="s1p53">GENERAL: Showed a well-developed, slightly obese man who was in extremis. NECK: Supple, with no jugular</p>
          <p id="s1p54">venous distension. HEART: Showed tachycardia without murmurs or gallops. PULMONARY: Status showed</p>
          <p id="s1p55">decreased breath sounds, but no clear-cut rales or wheezes. EXTREMITIES: Free of edema. HOSPITAL COURSE:</p>
          <p id="s1p56">The patient was admitted to the Special Care Unit and intubated. He received intravenous antibiotic therapy with</p>
          <p id="s1p57">Levaquin. He received intravenous diuretic therapy. He received hand-held bronchodilator therapy. The patient also was</p>
          <p id="s1p58">given intravenous steroid therapy with Solu-Medrol. The patient's course was one of gradual improvement, and after</p>
          <p id="s1p59">approximately three days, the patient was extubated. He continued to be quite dyspneic, with wheezes as well as basilar</p>
          <p id="s1p60">rales. After pulmonary consultation was obtained, the pulmonary consultant felt that the patient's overall clinical picture</p>
          <p id="s1p61">suggested that he had a significant element of congestive heart failure. With this, the patient was placed on increased</p>
          <p id="s1p62">doses of Lisinopril and Digoxin, with improvement of his respiratory status. On the day of discharge, the patient had</p>
          <p id="s1p63">minimal basilar rales; his chest also showed minimal expiratory wheezes; he had no edema; his heart rate was regular;</p>
          <p id="s1p64">his abdomen was soft; and his neck veins were not distended. It was, therefore, felt that the patient was stable for further</p>
          <p id="s1p65">management on an outpatient basis. DIAGNOSTIC DATA: The patient's admission laboratory data was notable for his</p>
          <p id="s1p66">initial blood gas, which showed a pH of 7.02 with a pCO2 of 118 and a pO2 of 103. The patient's electrocardiogram</p>
          <p id="s1p67">showed nonspecific ST-T wave changes. The patent's CBC showed a white count of 24,000, with 56% neutrophils and</p>
          <p id="s1p68">3% bands. DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged home. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: His diet was to be a 2</p>
          <p id="s1p69">grams sodium, 1800 calorie ADA diet. His medications were to be Prednisone 20 mg twice per day, Theo-24 400 mg</p>
          <p id="s1p70">per day, Furosemide 40 mg 1-1/2 tabs p.o. per day; Acetazolamide 250 mg one p.o. per day, Lisinopril 20 mg. one p.o.</p>

          <p id="s1p72">use a Ventolin inhaler every four hours as needed, and Azmacort four puffs twice per day. He was asked to return for</p>
          <p id="s1p73">follow-up with Dr. X in one to two weeks. Arrangements have been made for the patient to have an echocardiogram for</p>
          <p id="s1p74">further evaluation of his congestive heart failure later on the day of discharge.</p>
