Drug/biomarker association(s) supported by the highest level of clinical evidence.
Therapies associated with potential benefit or lack of benefit are based on biomarker results and published medical evidence derived from multiple tumor types. The selection of any,
all, or none of the matched therapies resides solely with the discretion of the treating physician. Decisions on patient care and treatment must be based on the independent medical
judgment of the treating physician, taking into consideration all available information concerning the patient's condition in accordance with the applicable standard of care.
