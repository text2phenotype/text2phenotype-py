End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis. 2. Historyof T9 vertebral fracture. 3. Diskitis. 4. Thrombocytopenia. 5. Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction ofapproximately 30%. 6. Diabetes, type 2. 7. Protein malnourishment. 8. History of anemia. HISTORY AND HOSPITALCOURSE: The patient is a 77-year-old white male who presented to Hospital of Bossier on April 14, 2008 with feverand severe lower back pain and severe weakness. The patient was found to have lumbar Diskitis that requires extensiveantibiotic therapy, which required hospitalization due to his dialysis. He also needed increase the frequency of hisdialysis due to worsening renal function. Dialysis time was extended and frequency was increased to three times perweek. He needed to begin active rehabilitation. The patient tolerated his medication well and he was going throughrehab fairly well without any significant troubles. He did have some bouts of issues with constipation on and offthroughout his hospitalization, but this seemed to come under control with more aggressive management. The patienthad remained afebrile. He did also have a bout with some episodic confusion problems, which appeared to be more of asundowner-type of a problem, but this too cleared with his stay here at Promise. On the day of discharge, on May 9,2008, the patient was in good spirits, was very clear and lucid. He denied any complaints of pain. He did have sometrouble with sleep at night at times, but I think this was mainly tied into the fact that he sleeps a lot during the day. Thepatient has increased his appetite some and has been eating some. His vital signs remain stable. His blood pressure ondischarge was 126/63, heart rate is 80, respiratory rate of 20 and temperature was 98.3. PPD was negative.

The patient and his family understood our plan and agreed with it. He thanked us for the care that he receivedat Promise and thought that they did a fantastic job taking care of him. He did not have any acute questions as to wherehe was going and what the next step of his care would be, but we did discuss this at length prior to date of discharge.His understanding of the complexity of his disease treatments appears to be low.
